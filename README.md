# Areas of Improvement Summary

**Program Coordinator: Evaluation Period Experience**

Being part of **CodePath.org** as a program coordinator is simply amazing and enjoying. Excellence became achievable through hard work, courage, patience, and support from the team. Having a privilege to gain additional knowledge from students'  submitted assignments and recorded sessions is so much to be thankful for. It is very exciting to think that someday CodePath will also provide college students in Asia particularly Filipinos with no-cost coding courses, mentorship, and career support in preparation for careers in tech.

## Improvements

These are some of the grader's (Ann Borbe) observations during the Evaluation Period.
:::

### TASK 3: Respond to observer channel questions on Slack

* Aside from indicating the Course Portal link of the respective observer channels, it will be easier for the observers to get the answers of their questions if the FAQ [link](https://support.codepath.org/help) could be added as well.

### TASK 4: Update SE10x Groove FAQ

* Continuously update Knowledge Base easily by adding **`Ask Question`** tab or the like to [support.codepath.org](https://support.codepath.org/help). The answer for a particular question will be automatically added as an article in [CodePath Knowledge Base](https://codepathorg.groovehq.com/kb/9422013794/articles) that will reflect to [FAQ](https://support.codepath.org/help).

### TASK 5: Facebook University iOS course management

* All improvements encountered during the process of grading are automaticaly put in the [write up](https://hackmd.io/LfAv-v2zSrGco7sDFgtx1g?view).

### TASK 6: iOS Tech Fellow training course management

* To be able to follow timeline of each task effectively, it is good to add instruction to plot TF related schedules on Codepath google calendar appending the name of the grader. This will help graders to improve their adherence to deadlines and be more productive.
